# 🔍 Basic Port Scanner (Python)

A simple TCP port scanner written in Python.  
It lets you scan a range of ports on a target host and prints which ports are open.

🔐 Ethical Use

This project is for learning cybersecurity and networking.
Do not scan:
	•	Networks or servers you don’t own
	•	Random IP addresses on the internet
	•	Any system without explicit permission

Unauthorized scanning can be illegal and against provider policies.

📝 Future Improvements
	•	Multi-threaded scanning for speed
	•	Service detection (e.g. HTTP, SSH, etc.)
	•	Save scan results to a file
	•	Add a simple GUI or web interface
